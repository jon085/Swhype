## Swhype

Created: February 2019

Created a super basic shell app with no network that has a swipe feature like Tinder.

Swipe Left/Right to swipe and shrink off the screen.
Tap Left/Right to change Image

Page View control can navigate between 3 screens.

Created in 4 evenings so it's just for demo purposes really.
Colours are horrible so it's just for adaption really.
Autolayout will work on screen rotation although wouldn't be useful.
This is part of a small piece I'm doing.
